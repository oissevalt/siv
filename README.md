# SIV

SIV is a Go implementation of Jean Tampon's [Stable Index Vector](https://github.com/johnBuffer/StableIndexVector). For the breakdown of this data structure, see his [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4xOCvELWlU).

This package is experimental, and bugs and performance issues can happen.
